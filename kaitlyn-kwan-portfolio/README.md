# Kaitlyn Kwan — Portfolio

A one-page portfolio site showcasing Kaitlyn's qualities, work, and contact info.

## How to view

Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or drag into a browser window). No build step required.

Or run a local server:

```bash
cd kaitlyn-kwan-portfolio
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then visit **http://localhost:8000**.

## Customize

- **About** — Edit the intro and highlights in `index.html` (section `#about`).
- **Qualities** — Change or add cards in the "What I Bring" section.
- **Work** — Replace "Project One/Two/Three" with real project names, descriptions, and links.
- **Contact** — Update the email and LinkedIn/GitHub (or other) links and remove the "Replace these" note.

Fonts load from Google Fonts (DM Serif Display + Outfit). Colors and spacing are in `styles.css` under `:root` if you want to tweak the look.
